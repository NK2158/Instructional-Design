      <h1>Week Five</h1>
      <h2>Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly</h2>
      <p>Last week, we delved into the world of relatively non-existent market structures. This week, we jump headlong into the two most prevalent market structures in modern economies: monopolistic competition and oligopolies. These two structures do have some similarities and at times can be very difficult to distinguish between them.</p>
      <p>It can be difficult not only because they are so prevalent, but also because one firm may sell various brands of a product that make it appear that there are plenty of choices for the consumer, but in fact, we are just giving the same firm our money regardless of the product we purchase. As we discussed, monopolies are not very consumer friendly. This can be expanded further to anytime there is less competition, then consumers are disadvantaged compared to the businesses.</p>
      <p>Because of this ability of large firms to exhibit market power, government has enacted various laws to counter the effect of monopoly power when industries start to consolidate into markets with a smaller number of large firms rather than a large number of smaller firms.</p>

	  <h2>Monopolistic Competition</h2>
      <p>There are three main characteristics of a monopolistically competitive market: large amounts of buyers and sellers, relative ease of entry and exit into the market, and heterogeneous products. As you can see, the characteristics of the monopolistically competitive market and the perfectly competitive market are very similar. The only major difference is that the products are heterogeneous rather than homogeneous.</p>
      
      <h3>Real-World Example: Fast Food Industry</h3>
      <p>The fast food industry is a very good example of a monopolistically competitive market. There are many different places in most areas where one can go get a hamburger. However, there is only one place to get a Big Mac, and only one place to go get a Whopper. Thus the overall market is competitive (many places to get a burger), but monopolistic in that there is only one seller of any particular type of burger.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      
      <h3>Product Differentiation</h3>
      <p>Within the monopolistically competitive market, firms distinguish themselves from their competitors through product differentiation. There are various ways that firms try to differentiate their products:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Product attributes:</strong> As mentioned with the Big Mac vs the Whopper, McDonald's and Burger King offer different styles of burgers to have consumers buy their products.</li>
        <li><strong>Service:</strong> Look at grocery stores. Some stores bag your groceries when you are finished, while others require customers to bag their own groceries.</li>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> Convenience stores are located throughout an area and at times, closer to residential areas than large grocery stores.</li>
        <li><strong>Brand names and advertising:</strong> Firms spend lots of money to create a brand name that consumers want to purchase based on advertising.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Pricing and Profits</h3>
      <p>Based on these product attributes, monopolistically competitive firms do have some control over price. If you want a Big Mac, you will pay what McDonald's charges. However, since there are other places to get a burger, McDonald's does have some restrictions on what it can charge.</p>
      <p>Because of this, firms in monopolistic competition can earn a very slight economic profit even in the long-run. If firms are earning economic profit in the short-run, more firms will enter the market, creating downward pressure on profits. One way that firms try to maintain those economic profits is to continually advertise to keep customers coming back and profits rolling in.</p>
      <p><strong>Important note:</strong> Unlike the perfectly competitive firm, monopolistically competitive firms are neither productively nor allocatively efficient.</p>

      <h2>Oligopoly</h2>
      <p>The characteristics of the oligopoly market are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A few large suppliers</li>
        <li>The product may be homogeneous or heterogeneous</li>
        <li>There are barriers to entry</li>
        <li>Firms have control over price, but there is mutual interdependence</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>As you can see, oligopolistic markets differ from monopolistically competitive markets by the fact there are fewer companies to purchase the products from and that those firms can offer the same type of product. Further, due to the size of the firms, it is very difficult for new firms to enter the market.</p>

      <h3>Three Basic Oligopoly Models</h3>
      
      <h4>1. Kinked-Demand Theory</h4>
      <p>This theory is based on the fact that when oligopolies compete, price increases are not matched by competitors, but if a firm does lower price to attract more customers, its competitors will match price.</p>
      
      <h4>2. Cartels and Collusion</h4>
      <p>A cartel is a situation where firms form an illegal alliance to keep output low and prices high. The most famous cartel is OPEC, which is made up of various oil producing countries.</p>
      
      <h4>3. Price Leadership Model</h4>
      <p>This occurs when there is one large firm that sets the price for the rest of the market.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Important note:</strong> Based on these models, oligopolies are neither allocatively nor productively efficient.</p>

    <h2>Market Power</h2>
    
    <h3>Consumer vs. Firm Preferences</h3>
    <p>As you can tell, consumers prefer the perfectly competitive or monopolistically competitive markets. Firms, on the other hand, prefer the oligopolistic or monopoly structures. This is because when there is good competition, we get more of the products at lower prices. With less competition, we get fewer products and higher prices.</p>
    
    <p>This is because firms in less competitive industries can have market power. A monopolist has the ultimate market power. In a perfectly competitive industry, no firm has any market power.</p>
    
    <h3>How Markets Become Less Competitive</h3>
    <p>In most situations, market power doesn't just exist. So, how do markets go from competitive to less competitive? The main way is by mergers. There are three types of mergers:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Horizontal mergers:</strong> Between firms in the same industry selling similar goods</li>
      <li><strong>Vertical mergers:</strong> Between firms at different stages of production</li>
      <li><strong>Conglomerate mergers:</strong> Between firms in unrelated industries</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The type of merger that hinders competition and can create market power is the horizontal merger. An example would be if McDonald's and Burger King were to merge.</p>

    <h3>Government Response: Antitrust Laws</h3>
    <p>In the late 1800s, many industries in the US were moving towards or had already turned into monopolies. Seeing the societal harm from these large companies, anti-monopoly laws were enacted to break up monopolies and to prevent monopolies from forming. The first, and most famous, act was the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. Since that time, many other laws have been passed to try and limit monopolies.</p>
    
    <h3>Natural Monopolies</h3>
    <p>In certain situations, some industries lead themselves to monopolistic behavior. Those firms are called natural monopolies. These occur when one firm can continually produce and sell more output at a lower average total cost than having two or more firms. These firms are generally utility companies, such as electric companies. To soften the negative impact of these monopolies, they are usually price regulated by a state regulatory board.</p>

                incorrect: "<strong>Explanation:</strong> Monopolistic competition has LOW barriers to entry, allowing firms to enter and exit freely. This is a key distinction from oligopolies, which have significant barriers. The other characteristics (many buyers/sellers, differentiated products, easy entry/exit) are all true of monopolistic competition."

                incorrect: "<strong>Explanation:</strong> An oligopoly consists of a FEW large firms that dominate the market (like airlines or cell phone carriers). This is different from perfect competition (many sellers), monopoly (one seller), or monopolistic competition (many firms with differentiated products)."

They differentiate through product attributes (features, quality), service levels, location convenience, and branding/advertising. Cartels are illegal and associated with oligopolies, not monopolistic competition."
